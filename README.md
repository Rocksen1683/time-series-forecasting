# Time-Series-Forecasting-Using-ARIMA

For the detailed explanation of the project, check out the Project Documentation in the Main Branch

We recommend downloading the below mentioned modules in a virtual env (all these modules need to be downloaded to run the code):

              KIVY
              Numpy 
              Pandas 
              Matplotlib
              sklearn
              yfinance

keep main.py, mymain.kv and the virtual env in the same folder in order to run the code

ARIMA_code.py is not needed to run the code you can run it to check the model without the app interface.
